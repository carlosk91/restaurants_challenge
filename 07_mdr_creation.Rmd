# Summary and context

This markdown document will answer the questions shared by DiDi hiring manager.
All of these are answered using SQL and R script.

A localhost database was created in order to show the query results. Because of 
that a simple run of the script wont publish the result again in another computer.

I'll present each question and follow it by the chunk of SQL needed to answer it.

# Challenge 1 

## Question 1 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

> Write the SQL queries necessary to generate a list of the five restaurants that have the highest average number of visitors on holidays. The result table should also contain that average per restaurant.

IMPORTANT: I didn't consider days without operation.

### Summary

```{r con, echo=FALSE}
con <- connect_to_db()
```

```{sql, connection = con}
SELECT id as restaurant_id, avg(visitors) as avg_daily_visitors_on_holiday
FROM 
(SELECT rv.id, visit_date, sum(rv.reserve_visitors) as visitors
FROM restaurant_visitors rv
LEFT JOIN date_info di on rv.visit_date = di.calendar_date
WHERE di.holiday_flg = 1
GROUP BY id, visit_date) hrv
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY avg_daily_visitors_on_holiday desc
LIMIT 5

```

### Additional Analysis

The top restaurant has an average of 33 daily customers on holidays:

```{r top_five_rest_in_holiday.barplot}
top_five_rest_in_holiday.barplot
```

But in reality, the 4th and 5th could be rearranged, if instead of using the mean
we use the median.

```{r top_five_rest_in_holiday.boxplot}
top_five_rest_in_holiday.boxplot
```

Its important to view the full distribution when a mean vs mean analysis is
requested. 

```{r top_five_rest_in_holiday.densityplot}
top_five_rest_in_holiday.densityplot
```

## Question 2 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

> Use SQL to discover which day of the week there are usually more visitors on average in restaurants.

IMPORTANT: I didn't consider days without operation.

### Total visitors

```{sql, connection = con}
SELECT
day_of_week,
avg(visitors) as avg_visitors_by_weekday
FROM
(SELECT 
rv.visit_date, 
di.day_of_week, 
sum(reserve_visitors) as visitors
FROM restaurant_visitors rv
LEFT JOIN date_info di on rv.visit_date = di.calendar_date
GROUP BY visit_date, day_of_week) vrw
GROUP BY day_of_week
ORDER BY avg_visitors_by_weekday DESC

```

Saturday is the weekday with more avg costumers (bar plot). 
But the median (blue points) is almost the same on Friday and Saturday.

```{r weekday_w_more_visitors.barplot}
weekday_w_more_visitors.barplot
```

The distribution of Saturday tends to be higher, just with almost the same median as Friday.
The distribution is skewed to the right, that's whey there's a big difference between median and mean.

```{r weekday_w_more_visitors.boxplot}
weekday_w_more_visitors.boxplot
```

### By restaurant

```{sql, connection = con}
SELECT
day_of_week,
avg(visitors) as avg_visitors_by_store_by_weekday
FROM
(SELECT 
id, 
visit_date, 
day_of_week, 
sum(reserve_visitors) as visitors
FROM restaurant_visitors rv
LEFT JOIN date_info di on rv.visit_date = di.calendar_date
GROUP BY id, visit_date, day_of_week) vrw
GROUP BY day_of_week
ORDER BY avg_visitors_by_store_by_weekday DESC

```

In average, Saturday is the weekday with more avg visitors by restaurant (17).
But again, the distribution of Friday and Saturday is not that different.
The median number of visitors on each store in Friday and Saturday is 12.
There are multiple outliers in all weekdays

```{r weekday_w_more_visitors_by_rest.barplot}
weekday_w_more_visitors_by_rest.barplot
```

```{r weekday_w_more_visitors_by_rest.boxplot}
weekday_w_more_visitors_by_rest.boxplot
```


## Question 3 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

> How was the percentage of growth of the amount of visitorsâ€™ week over week for the last four weeks of the data? You can solve this question using SQL or any other tool that you prefer. If you use other tools, please add your code or files. 

### Summary

```{sql, connection = con}
WITH 
last_date as (
SELECT date((max(visit_date) - 4*7))
FROM restaurant_visitors
),
daily_visitors as (
SELECT 
DATE_SUB(visit_date, INTERVAL DAYOFWEEK(visit_date)-2 DAY) as visit_week, 
sum(reserve_visitors) as visitors
FROM restaurant_visitors rv
LEFT JOIN date_info di on rv.visit_date = di.calendar_date
GROUP BY visit_week
ORDER BY visit_week
),
weekly_growth as (
(SELECT 
visit_week,  
visitors,
visitors /
lag(visitors, 1) OVER (ORDER BY visit_week) - 1 as weekly_visitors_growth
FROM daily_visitors)
)

SELECT *
FROM weekly_growth
WHERE visit_week >= (select * from last_date)


```

There has been a continuous decrease in visitors the last 4 weeks

```{r visitors_weekly_growth_percentage.lineplot}
visitors_weekly_growth_percentage.lineplot
```

### Additional analysis

There's a gap in 2016, from the weeks of Jul 25 to Sep 12.
And it appears that the number of visitors drastically decreased from
the week of Apr 17, 2017 onward.

#### Weekly visitors

```{r weekly_visitors.lineplot}
weekly_visitors.lineplot
```

#### Monthly visitors

```{r monthly_visitors.lineplot}
monthly_visitors.lineplot
```

#### Daily visitors

```{r daily_visitors.lineplot}
daily_visitors.lineplot
```

The number of visitors last month drastically decreased. It appears that it went 
to the same average of 2016. 
But the number of unique restaurants didn't decreased as much.

```{r monthly_restaurants.lineplot}
monthly_restaurants.lineplot
```

The average visitors by restaurant decreased in May 2017. But in general is
around 161 visitors.

```{r monthly_avg_visitors_by_rest.lineplot}
monthly_avg_visitors_by_rest.lineplot
```

## Question 4 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

> Forecast for the next six months, after the last date of the data, the sum of visitors of all the restaurants and validate the accuracy of your forecast.

I created two forecasts and challenged them against each other:

1. An ensemble model, the product of two forecasts. Number of restaurants and the average visitors by restaurant.This so the model can be more accurate and to have more control on the results if an actionable is known, i.e. a strategy to acquire more restaurants.
2. I'll create a forecast directly for the total number of visitors. 

The model with the least MAE was be used to forecast the next 6 months.

### Forecast results

```{r monthly_visitors_fcst.lineplot}
monthly_visitors_fcst.lineplot
```

The mode shows that Jun is being forecasted with the same bouncing effect that Jun 2016
had. Keeping close attention the the forecast and updating if required is important so the process improves month over month.

### Process to select the forecast

I'll show the results of the three time series:
* Number of average visitors by restaurant
* Number of restaurants
* Number of visitors

Given the change of distribution in the behavior of the time series
and the shortage of data, I created the forecast using ARIMA,
Averages, Naive, Seasonal Naive, and TBATS. And I will select the best forecast
comparing the MAE of each model using a training and test set.

#### Models metrics {.tabset}

##### ARIMA

Applying and auto.arima, p and q are 0.
For average visitors by restaurant is purely white noise (d is 0).
For restaurants is a random walk (d is 1).
For total visitors is, again, a random walk (d is 1).
Given average visitors is white noise the point forecast will be the same as
a mean method.
And because restaurants and total visitors are a random walk, the point forecast
be the same as a naive model.
Reference:  https://people.duke.edu/~rnau/411arim.htm

###### Average visitors by restaurant

```{r arima_avg_visitors_by_rest}
arima_models[[1]]
arima_model_result[[1]][,'MAE']
```

###### Unique restaurants

The gap between train and test set MAE is really high
```{r arima_unique_restaurants}
arima_models[[2]]
arima_model_result[[2]][,'MAE']
```

###### Total visitors

The gap between train and test set MAE is really high
```{r arima_total_visitors}
arima_models[[3]]
arima_model_result[[3]][,'MAE']
```

##### Average

Residuals on avg visitors and restaurant are white noise. I could rely on the
results.

###### Average visitors by restaurant

```{r average_avg_visitors_by_rest}
avg_models[[1]]
avg_model_result[[1]][,'MAE']
```

###### Unique restaurants

```{r average_unique_restaurants}
avg_models[[2]]
avg_model_result[[2]][,'MAE']
```

###### Total visitors

```{r average_total_visitors}
avg_models[[3]]
avg_model_result[[3]][,'MAE']
```

##### Naive

Residuals on avg visitors and restaurant are not white noise, that means that
something underlyin can be explained with more analysis. But I'll keep the 
results if they succeed on the challenge.

###### Average visitors by restaurant

```{r naive_avg_visitors_by_rest}
naive_models[[1]]
naive_model_result[[1]][,'MAE']
```

###### Unique restaurants

```{r naive_unique_restaurants}
naive_models[[2]]
naive_model_result[[2]][,'MAE']
```

###### Total visitors

```{r naive_total_visitors}
naive_models[[3]]
naive_model_result[[3]][,'MAE']
```

##### Seasonal Naive

Seasonal Naive is tricky to use when only one season has passed. Nonetheless here
are the results.

###### Average visitors by restaurant

```{r snaive_avg_visitors_by_rest}
snaive_models[[1]]
snaive_model_result[[1]][,'MAE']
```

###### Unique restaurants

```{r snaive_unique_restaurants}
snaive_models[[2]]
snaive_model_result[[2]][,'MAE']
```

###### Total visitors

```{r snaive_total_visitors}
snaive_models[[3]]
snaive_model_result[[3]][,'MAE']
```

##### TBATS

TBATS is the combination of Trigonometric seasonality, Box-Cox transformation, ARIMA errors Trend, Seasonal components

This methodolgy tends to perform well when there's more than one single distribution in a time serie.
Something that is presented in all of three.

###### Average visitors by restaurant

```{r tbats_avg_visitors_by_rest}
tbats_models[[1]]
tbats_model_result[[1]][,'MAE']
```

###### Unique restaurants

```{r tbats_unique_restaurants}
tbats_models[[2]]
tbats_model_result[[2]][,'MAE']
```

###### Total visitors

```{r tbats_total_visitors}
tbats_models[[3]]
tbats_model_result[[3]][,'MAE']
```

#### Method selection, challenging models
After the previous analysis we discovered that:
* TBATS had the best performance for average monthly visitors. Even though it had overfitting, had the least MAE against the test set. Future analysis would be required to maintain the forecast. 
* Naive forecast had a good result on unique restaurants. Its a simple method but when erratic, it is a good and easy approach to forecast.

Now I evaluated which model is more accurate. I did an ensemble model
multiplying average visitors by unique restaurants results and compared it against
total visitors forecast. I selected the method with the least MAE against test set.

```{r mae_ttl_visitors}
mae_ttl_visitors
```

Ensemble model is more accurate. It has an average absolute error of 1986.
That means that the result in average each month will have a forecast Â± 1986
total visitors.

Once the method was selected, I did and update on naive and TBATS model so they included
the latest data. With that I forecasted from Jun to Nov



## Question 5 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

> Based on the data and your ideas, plan strategies to double the total restaurant visitors in six months. 

Strategies that in total could double the amount of visitors

### Strategy 1
1. Add more restaurants in cities with high population density.
There are multiple cities where there's high population density but with lower
number of restaurants.

```{r restaurants_position}
restaurants_position
```

Below is a Japan population density plot
![Japan population density](jp_population_density.png)

### Strategy 2
2. Add more genres of food
There was a hughe increase after more genres were implemented.
Izakaya had a great impact on visitors. I would suggest to explore a healthy
or international food segment.

```{r visitors_by_genre.barplot}
visitors_by_genre.barplot
```

### Strategy 3
3. Set reminder to reserve a visit to favorite place or suggest other options.
Fridays and Saturdays have a higher number of days between reservation and
visit. It could help send reminders to reserve a restaurant. And if the
the restaurant is already fully booked we can suggest a similar place with
available seats.

```{r days_from_reserve_to_visit.boxplot}
days_from_reserve_to_visit.boxplot
```
Note: You can zoom-in where the boxplots are located, all the outliers impact zooming-out the boxplot graph.

### Strategy 4
4. Gather more data.
Lastly, the forecast tells us that maybe without any additional effort next month we 
will without any doubt double the number of visitors of last month. So it would be a great time
to get more data and more variables.

## Question 6

> Imagine that these restaurants are in your city (and not in Japan), what other data would you want to join in order of get more insights to increase the visitors?

### User information. 
This is crucial to understand what drives the user to
reserve or purchase anything. Age, consumption habits, etc.

### App usage information is extremely important.
Maybe there's a high traffic of requests to visit a place but something in the
funnel makes the user drop the reservation.

### Prices of the places and more information of the restaurant is crucial
There could be the opportunity to understand demand elasticity given different
prices. I've stopped placing orders in some restaurants because the price
increased a lot.

# Challenge 2

## Question 1 

> How many active users and new users do we have for each week of November 2019 to February 2020?

Definitions
New user definition:
Count of unique user ids on each user min order_info.order_date
Active user definition:
Unique user with order grouped by order_info.order_date.

```{sql, connection = con}
WITH 
new_users as (
SELECT 
user_id, 
min(order_date) as order_date
FROM order_info oi
GROUP BY user_id
),
weekly_new_users as (
select 
DATE_SUB(order_date, 
	INTERVAL DAYOFWEEK(order_date)-2 DAY) as order_week, 
count(distinct user_id) as new_users
from new_users
group by order_week
),
weekly_unique_active_users as (
SELECT 
DATE_SUB(order_date, 
	INTERVAL DAYOFWEEK(order_date)-2 DAY) as order_week, 
count(distinct user_id) as active_users
FROM order_info oi
GROUP BY order_week
)

SELECT *
FROM weekly_unique_active_users wau 
LEFT JOIN weekly_new_users wnu USING (order_week)
WHERE order_week between '2019-11-01' and '2020-02-29'
ORDER BY order_week

```

For question 4

```{r new_and_active_weekly_users.lineplot}
new_and_active_weekly_users.lineplot
```

## Question 2

> How many reengaged users do we have (Reengaged: active this week that didnâ€™t have an order last week but they did before that) for each week of November 2019 to February 2020?

Reengaged Users metric definition:
Count of unique user ids where the number of weeks between current order date
and previous one is greater than 1.

```{sql, connection = con}
WITH 
user_by_week AS (
SELECT 
*,
lag(order_week, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY user_id) previous_order_week
FROM
(SELECT 
user_id,
DATE_SUB(order_date, 
	INTERVAL DAYOFWEEK(order_date)-2 DAY) as order_week
FROM order_info oi
GROUP BY user_id, order_week
ORDER BY user_id, order_week) upw
),
reengaged_users AS (
SELECT *, floor(DATEDIFF(order_week, previous_order_week)/7) as inactive_weeks
FROM user_by_week ubw
WHERE floor(DATEDIFF(order_week, previous_order_week)/7) > 1
)

SELECT order_week, count(distinct user_id) as reengaged_users
FROM reengaged_users ru
WHERE order_week between '2019-11-01' and '2020-02-29'
GROUP BY order_week
ORDER BY order_week

```

For question 4

```{r weekly_reengaged_users.lineplot}
weekly_reengaged_users.lineplot
```

## Question 3

> Whatâ€™s the average GMV by type of user (Active, new, reengaged) for each week of November 2019 to February 2020?

IMPORTANT: The definitions of each of the three user types are not mutually
exclusive, new users and reengaged users are in fact active users.

```{sql, connection = con}
WITH 
user_by_week AS (
SELECT 
*,
lag(order_week, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY user_id) previous_order_week
FROM
(SELECT 
user_id,
DATE_SUB(order_date, 
	INTERVAL DAYOFWEEK(order_date)-2 DAY) as order_week
FROM order_info oi
GROUP BY user_id, order_week
ORDER BY user_id, order_week) upw
),
reengaged_users AS (
SELECT *, floor(DATEDIFF(order_week, previous_order_week)/7) as inactive_weeks
FROM user_by_week ubw
WHERE floor(DATEDIFF(order_week, previous_order_week)/7) > 1
),
weekly_reengaged_users AS (
SELECT order_week, user_id
FROM reengaged_users ru
GROUP BY order_week, user_id
ORDER BY order_week, user_id
),
reengaged_users_orders AS (
SELECT 
wru.order_week, 
avg(gmv) as avg_gmv
FROM weekly_reengaged_users wru
LEFT JOIN order_info oi ON 
	(wru.user_id = oi.user_id AND
		DATE_SUB(oi.order_date, 
			INTERVAL DAYOFWEEK(order_date)-2 DAY) =
		wru.order_week)
GROUP BY wru.order_week
),
new_users_orders AS (
SELECT 
DATE_SUB(oi.order_date, 
	INTERVAL DAYOFWEEK(order_date)-2 DAY) as order_week, 
avg(gmv) as avg_gmv
FROM user_info ui
LEFT JOIN order_info oi ON 
	(ui.first_order = oi.order_id AND oi.user_id = ui.user_id)
GROUP BY order_week
),
active_users_orders as (
SELECT 
DATE_SUB(order_date, 
	INTERVAL DAYOFWEEK(order_date)-2 DAY) as order_week, 
avg(gmv) as avg_gmv
FROM order_info oi
GROUP BY order_week
)

SELECT *, 'New User' AS user_type
FROM new_users_orders nuo
WHERE nuo.order_week between '2019-11-01' and '2020-02-29'
UNION
SELECT *, 'Active User' AS user_type
FROM active_users_orders auo
WHERE auo.order_week between '2019-11-01' and '2020-02-29'
UNION
SELECT *, 'Reengaged User' AS user_type
FROM reengaged_users_orders ruo
WHERE ruo.order_week between '2019-11-01' and '2020-02-29'

```

For question 4

```{r avg_gmv_per_user_type.lineplot}
avg_gmv_per_user_type.lineplot
```

## Question 4

> On your preferred tool (Excel, Python, R, etc.) please create charts for each of your results.

I placed the graphs on each question

## Question 5

> Based on the charts give your opinion/recommendations regarding to the different type of users.

### Recommentaion 1
1. Create segments for recurring users based on the number of orders they've made. 

It's important to have order_date as time stamp.
It allows you to understand whats the number of orders before churning and
the level of engagement the users have with your application.

```{r avg_gmv_by_order_n.lineplot}
avg_gmv_by_order_n.lineplot
```

Order number definition: Number of order by user_id, is cumulative.

### Recommentaion 2
2. A high percentage of users only has 1 single order. If DiDi has a high churn rate, then it won't be able to have a sustainable growth. There should be more analysis into why this is happening.

It's important to have order_date as time stamp.
It allows you to understand whats the number of orders before churning and
the level of engagement the users have with your application.

```{r inactive_users}
inactive_users.sankeyplot
```

### Recommentaion 3
3. There should be experiments with behavioral economics to accelerate engagement and ordering. As the number of order increases, the number of days to recur decreases.

```{r days_to_recur.boxplot}
days_to_recur.boxplot
```
